Before You Start
----------------

To run this tutorial, you’ll need to install PyTorch, TorchVision,
Matplotlib, and TensorBoard.

With ``conda``::

    conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
    conda install matplotlib tensorboard

With ``pip``::

    pip install torch torchvision matplotlib tensorboard

Once the dependencies are installed, restart this notebook in the Python
environment where you installed them.


Introduction
------------
 
In this notebook, we’ll be training a variant of LeNet-5 against the
Fashion-MNIST dataset. Fashion-MNIST is a set of image tiles depicting
various garments, with ten class labels indicating the type of garment
depicted.

Above, we used TorchVision and Matplotlib to create a visual grid of a
minibatch of our input data. Below, we use the ``add_image()`` call on
``SummaryWriter`` to log the image for consumption by TensorBoard, and
we also call ``flush()`` to make sure it’s written to disk right away.

    # Default log_dir argument is "runs" - but it's good to be specific

    # Write image data to TensorBoard log dir
    writer.add_image('Four Fashion-MNIST Images', img_grid)

    # To view, start TensorBoard on the command line with:

If you start TensorBoard at the command line and open it in a new
browser tab (usually at `localhost:6006 <localhost:6006>`__), you should
see the image grid under the IMAGES tab.

Graphing Scalars to Visualize Training
--------------------------------------

TensorBoard is useful for tracking the progress and efficacy of your
training. Below, we’ll run a training loop, track some metrics, and save
the data for TensorBoard’s consumption.

Let’s define a model to categorize our image tiles, and an optimizer and
loss function for training:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 160-186

.. code-block:: default


    class Net(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super(Net, self).__init__()
            self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 6, 5)
            self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
            self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
            self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 4 * 4, 120)
            self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
            self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)

        def forward(self, x):
            x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
            x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
            x = x.view(-1, 16 * 4 * 4)
            x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
            x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
            x = self.fc3(x)
            return x
    

    net = Net()
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)

Now let’s train a single epoch, and evaluate the training vs. validation
set losses every 1000 batches:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 190-232

.. code-block:: default


    print(len(validation_loader))
    for epoch in range(1):  # loop over the dataset multiple times
        running_loss = 0.0

        for i, data in enumerate(training_loader, 0):
            # basic training loop
            inputs, labels = data
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = net(inputs)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

            running_loss += loss.item()
            if i % 1000 == 999:    # Every 1000 mini-batches...
                print('Batch {}'.format(i + 1))
                # Check against the validation set
                running_vloss = 0.0
            
                net.train(False) # Don't need to track gradents for validation
                for j, vdata in enumerate(validation_loader, 0):
                    vinputs, vlabels = vdata
                    voutputs = net(vinputs)

                                epoch * len(training_loader) + i)

Switch to your open TensorBoard and have a look at the SCALARS tab.

Visualizing Your Model
----------------------

TensorBoard can also be used to examine the data flow within your model.
To do this, call the ``add_graph()`` method with a model and sample
input. When you open


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 242-253

.. code-block:: default


    # Again, grab a single mini-batch of images
    dataiter = iter(training_loader)
    images, labels = next(dataiter)

    # add_graph() will trace the sample input through your model,
    # and render it as a graph.
    writer.add_graph(net, images)
    writer.flush()









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 254-271

When you switch over to TensorBoard, you should see a GRAPHS tab.
Double-click the “NET” node to see the layers and data flow within your
model.

Visualizing Your Dataset with Embeddings
----------------------------------------

The 28-by-28 image tiles we’re using can be modeled as 784-dimensional
vectors (28 \* 28 = 784). It can be instructive to project this to a
lower-dimensional representation. The ``add_embedding()`` method will
project a set of data onto the three dimensions with highest variance,
and display them as an interactive 3D chart. The ``add_embedding()``
method does this automatically by projecting to the three dimensions
with highest variance.

Below, we’ll take a sample of our data, and generate such an embedding:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 271-294

.. code-block:: default


    # Select a random subset of data and corresponding labels
    def select_n_random(data, labels, n=100):
        assert len(data) == len(labels)

        perm = torch.randperm(len(data))
        return data[perm][:n], labels[perm][:n]

    # Extract a random subset of data
    images, labels = select_n_random(training_set.data, training_set.targets)

    # get the class labels for each image
    class_labels = [classes[label] for label in labels]

    # log embeddings
    features = images.view(-1, 28 * 28)
    writer.add_embedding(features,
                        metadata=class_labels,
                        label_img=images.unsqueeze(1))
    writer.flush()
    writer.close()









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 295-316

Now if you switch to TensorBoard and select the PROJECTOR tab, you
should see a 3D representation of the projection. You can rotate and
zoom the model. Examine it at large and small scales, and see whether
you can spot patterns in the projected data and the clustering of
labels.

For better visibility, it’s recommended to:

- Select “label” from the “Color by” drop-down on the left.
- Toggle the Night Mode icon along the top to place the
  light-colored images on a dark background.
